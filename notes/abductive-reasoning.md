# Abductive reasoning

> In one sense, it is strange that after all these years abduction is still unfamiliar to the general public: not on a par with deduction and induction. In another sense, however, it is also remarkable that abduction has been extensively studied by artificial intelligence researchers, cognitive scientists, and semioticians as well as by philosophers of science. --- Woosuk Park, "On classifying abduction," *Journal of Applied Logic* 13 (2015)

> All cats die.
> Socrates is dead.
> Therefore, Socrates is a cat.
