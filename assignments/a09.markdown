# A09: Recipe classification

This assignment helps you practice classification of textual documents. We will be using data from the [What's Cooking?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking) Kaggle competition.

## Task

Predict the kind of cuisine based on the ingredients. Find the best data transformations and classification technique, and report your procedure and accuracy.

## Data

Create a free Kaggle account and download the [train.json](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data) file. Use the Python script below to transform this file into CSV format. You may wish to modify this script to cleanup the recipe ingredients (remove bogus characters, etc.).

```python
import sys
import re
import json
import io
reload(sys)
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
from pprint import pprint

with io.open(sys.argv[1], encoding='utf8') as jsonin:
    jrecipes = json.load(jsonin)
    print "ingredients,cuisine"
    for recipe in jrecipes:
        print '\"%s\",%s' % (' '.join(map(lambda x: re.sub(r'\s', '_', x),
                             recipe['ingredients'])), recipe['cuisine'])
```

Run the script as follows, assuming the script is saved as `json2csv.py`:

```
python json2csv.py train.json > train.csv
```

or if on delenn:

```
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 python2 json2csv.py train.json > train.csv
```

## delenn for training

Feel free to use delenn to train. Refer to the [Weka](/notes/weka-classification.html) notes for details.

## Deliverables

Submit each of the following:

- Any code you write to transform the data.
- Documentation of the Weka operations you performed, in the order performed.
- A report of the accuracy of the ZeroR and OneR classifiers with 10-fold cross validation (include pct correct, prec/recall/f-measure, confusion matrix).
- A report of the accuracy of your best classifier with 10-fold cross validation (include pct correct, prec/recall/f-measure, confusion matrix).

## Grading rubric

Grading of this assignment will be somewhat subjective. Iâ€™ll be looking for evidence of poor methodology.

To earn full credit, data must be processed correctly and the classifiers must be evaluated correctly. The best classifier must have a weighted average F-measure > 0.710 on 10-fold cross-validation with the training set. The methodology must be sophisticated, correct, and well-documented.
